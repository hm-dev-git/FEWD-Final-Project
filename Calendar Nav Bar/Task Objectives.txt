#13:00 - make the day of the month fill in the weekday box
##then, have special highlighting for the current day 
learnings:
>13:30 - have to use an actual date object, as in a variable defined by the function Date() to get half the shit to work. Cool
>13:50 - switched my HTML ids to 3char weekday names to improve compatibility with JS functions

#15:00 got the days to work! now focusing on margins and such

#15:40 - background image fun
>15:41 - change the font colors and such

Moving forward
Browser compatibility? don’t use moz or webkit all that much, like for text align
